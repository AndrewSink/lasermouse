Laser Mouse!

Designed to use an Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 board, 996R servo, USB battery bank, and laser pointer to create a laser cat toy. 

Connect the red wire from the servo to the 'USB' pin, the brown wire to 'GND', and the orange wire to pin 14. Depending on
your laser, you may be able to wire it directly to the '3V' and 'GND' pins.

Parts printed on a Prusa MK3S using Galaxy Black Prusament material.
